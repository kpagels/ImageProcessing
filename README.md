This git hub folder includes code for 5 different classifiers and scripts for plotting. The MNIST and ORL data are used.
```
5 main files for running the classifiers are the following:
```
### Nearest Centroid Classifier
The Nearest Centroid Classifier has the 
main_nearestClassifier
* testNCC.m 
* trainingNCC.m / trainingNCC2.m

### Nearest Neighbor Classifier
main_nearestNeighbor
* testNCC.m
        
### Nearest Sub-class Classifier
main_nearestsubClassifier
* trainingNSC.m
        
### Perceptron trained using Backpropagation 
main_Perceptron_batch
* testPBP.m
* trainingPBP.m
        
### Perceptron using Mean Square Error
main_Perceptron_MSE.m
* trainingMSE.m
